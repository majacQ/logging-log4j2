* Fixed problem with JDBC and JPA appender connectivity in WebSphere by connecting (borrowing from pool) on new
        write internal or on flush. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-442[LOG4J2-442] by `nickwilliams`)

* Exposed Log4j web support interface and methods and the LoggerContext through ServletContext attributes

        utility instead of instantiating URI directly. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-409[LOG4J2-409] by `nickwilliams`)
* Added a ServletContext attribute that, when set to "true", disables Log4j's auto-initialization in
        Servlet 3.0+ web applications. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-452[LOG4J2-452] by `nickwilliams`)

* hostName property was not being set until after the first configuration element. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-470[LOG4J2-470] by `rgoers`)

* Fixed issue where toString methods that perform logging could deadlock AsyncAppender. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-485[LOG4J2-485] by `rpopma`)
* Fixed error in documentation code example in manual/eventlogging.html (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-408[LOG4J2-408] by `rpopma`)
* Use the formatted Message in RFC5424Layout for non-StructuredDataMessages. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-430[LOG4J2-430] by `rgoers`)
* Fixed documentation for MyApp example application in the Automatic Configuration section (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-463[LOG4J2-463] by `rpopma`)

* (JMX) Fixed issue where log4j2 LoggerContext did not show up in JMX GUI or JConsole. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-443[LOG4J2-443] by `rpopma`)
