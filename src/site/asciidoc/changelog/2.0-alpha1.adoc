= 2.0-alpha1 (2012-07-29)

== Changes

=== Added

* Added ability to filter on the AppenderRef by adding either a level or a filter. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-60[LOG4J2-60] by `rgoers`)

=== Fixed

* Make sure all application facing log methods use their own FQCN. This patch
        resolves a unit test failure for the %C pattern when using the Category logger. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-50[LOG4J2-50] by `rgoers`)
* Remove LoggerContext support for custom logger factories. All Loggers returned
        by LoggerContext should be compatible and of the same type. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-51[LOG4J2-51] by `rgoers`)
* Level.toLevel would throw an IllegalArgumentException instead of returning the default value. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-56[LOG4J2-56] by `rgoers`)
