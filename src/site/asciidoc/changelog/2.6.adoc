= 2.6 (2016-05-25)

The Apache Log4j 2 team is pleased to announce the Log4j 2.6 release!

Apache Log4j is a well-known framework for logging application behavior.
Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides many other modern features such as support for Markers, property substitution using Lookups, multiple patterns on a `PatternLayout` and asynchronous Loggers.
In addition, Log4j 2 will not lose events while reconfiguring.

This is the tenth GA release.
It contains several bugfixes and new features.
The new features include the ability to be _garbage-free_ (avoid allocating temporary objects) while logging if certain conditions are met, a new YAML Layout, the ability to merge configuration files, and documenting Log4j's performance against other logging frameworks and in various logging configurations.
More details on the features and bugfixes are itemized below.

Note that subsequent to the release a minor source incompatibility was found due to the addition of new methods to the `Logger` interface.
If you have code that does:

[source,java]
----
logger.error(null, “This is the log message”, throwable);
----

or similar with any log level you will get a compiler error saying the reference is ambiguous.
To correct this either do:

[source,java]
----
logger.error(“This is the log message”, throwable);
----

or

[source,java]
----
logger.error((Marker) null, “This is the log message”, throwable);
----

Log4j 2.6 maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.

Log4j 2.6 requires a minimum of Java 7 to build and run.
Log4j 2.3 was the last release that supported Java 6.

Basic compatibility with Log4j 1.x is provided through the `log4j-1.2-api` component, however it does
not implement some of the very implementation specific classes and methods.
The package names and Maven `groupId` have been changed to `org.apache.logging.log4j` to avoid any conflicts with Log4j 1.x.

For complete information on Apache Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for improvement, see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[the Apache Log4j 2 website].
