= 2.11.1 (2018-07-22)

The Apache Log4j 2 team is pleased to announce the Log4j 2.11.1 release!

Apache Log4j is a well-known framework for logging application behavior.
Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides many other modern features such as support for Markers, lambda expressions for lazy logging, property substitution using Lookups, multiple patterns on a `PatternLayout` and asynchronous Loggers.
Another notable Log4j 2 feature is the ability to be _garbage-free_ (avoid allocating temporary objects) while logging.
In addition, Log4j 2 will not lose events while reconfiguring.

This release contains new features, bugfixes and minor enhancements.

Due to a break in compatibility in the SLF4J binding, Log4j now ships with two versions of the SLF4J to Log4j adapters.
`log4j-slf4j-impl` should be used with SLF4J 1.7.x and earlier and `log4j-slf4j18-impl` should be used with SLF4J 1.8.x and later.

As of Log4j 2.9.0, the Log4j API was modified to use `java.util.ServiceLoader` to locate Log4j implementations, although the former binding mechanism is still supported.
The Log4j API JAR is now a multi-release JAR to provide implementations of Java 9 specific classes.
Multi-release JARs are not supported by the OSGi specification so OSGi modules will not be able to take advantage of these implementations but will not lose functionality as they will fall back to the implementations used in Java 7 and 8.
More details on the new features and fixes are itemized below.
Note that some tools are not compatible with multi-release JARs and may fail trying to process class files in the `META-INF/versions/9` folder.
Those errors should be reported to the tool vendor.

Note that subsequent to the 2.9.0 release, for security reasons, `SerializedLayout` is deprecated and no longer used as default in the Socket and JMS appenders.
`SerializedLayout` can still be used as before, but has to be specified explicitly.
To retain old behaviour, you have to change configuration like:

[source,xml]
----
<Appenders>
  <Socket name="socket" host="localhost" port="9500"/>
</Appenders>
----

into:

[source,xml]
----
<Appenders>
  <Socket name="socket" host="localhost" port="9500">
    <SerializedLayout/>
  </Socket>
</Appenders>
----

We do, however, discourage the use of `SerializedLayout` and recommend `JsonLayout` as a replacement:

[source,xml]
----
<Appenders>
  <Socket name="socket" host="localhost" port="9500">
    <JsonLayout properties="true"/>
  </Socket>
</Appenders>
----

Note that subsequent to the 2.9.0 release, for security reasons, Log4j does not process DTD in XML files.
If you used DTD for including snippets, you have to use XInclude or Composite Configuration instead.

The Log4j 2.11.1 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.

Log4j 2.11.1 requires a minimum of Java 7 to build and run.
Log4j 2.3 was the last release that supported Java 6.

Basic compatibility with Log4j 1.x is provided through the `log4j-1.2-api` component, however it does
not implement some of the very implementation specific classes and methods.
The package names and Maven `groupId` have been changed to `org.apache.logging.log4j` to avoid any conflicts with Log4j 1.x.

For complete information on Apache Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for improvement, see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[the Apache Log4j 2 website].

* Custom ContextSelector implementations which select an AsyncLoggerContext disable LoggerConfig.includeLocation

* RingBufferLogEvent memento messages provide the expected format string, and no longer attempt to substitute parameters into curly braces in parameter toString values.
        Both RingBufferLogEvent and MutableLogEvent memento implementations memoize results to avoid rebuilding formatted string values. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-2352[LOG4J2-2352] by `ckozak`)
* Fixed a memory leak in which ReusableObjectMessage would hold a reference to the most recently logged object. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-2362[LOG4J2-2362] by `ckozak`)
* Make java.util.ServiceLoader properly work in OSGi by using the Service Loader Mediator Specification. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-2305[LOG4J2-2305] by `rgoers`, Björn Kautler)

        caused by an NPE while initializing the static PropertiesUtil field. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-2355[LOG4J2-2355] by `ckozak`, Henrik Brautaset Aronsen)
* StringBuilders.escapeJson implementation runs in linear time. Escaping large JSON strings
        in EncodingPatternConverter and MapMessage will perform significantly better. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-2373[LOG4J2-2373] by `ckozak`, Kevin Meurer)
* ThrowableProxy was saving and retrieving cache entries using different keys. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-2389[LOG4J2-2389] by `rgoers`, Liu Wen)

* StringBuilders.escapeXml implementation runs in linear time. Escaping large XML strings
        in EncodingPatternConverter and MapMessage will perform significantly better. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-2376[LOG4J2-2376] by `ckozak`, Kevin Meurer)
* Thread indefinitely blocked when logging a message in an interrupted thread. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-2388[LOG4J2-2388] by `ggregory`, Failled)
