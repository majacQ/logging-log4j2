=== Changed

* Renamed FastFileAppender and FastRollingFileAppender to RandomAccessFileAppender
        and RollingRandomAccessFileAppender. Configurations using the Fast(Rolling)File element
        no longer work and should be modified to use the (Rolling)RandomAccessFile element. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-317[LOG4J2-317] by `ggregory`)
* Changed the (relatively new) PatternLayout configuration attribute "suppressExceptions" to
        "alwaysWriteExceptions" to more correctly indicate what it does. As such, the meaning of this attribute has
        reversed (previous "true"s should become "false"s, and vice versa). Since this was an undocumented attribute up
        until now, it's unlikely this change will affect any users. (by `nickwilliams`)
* Changed the "suppressExceptions" configuration attribute for all Appenders to "ignoreExceptions" to avoid
        confusion with Java 7 suppressed exceptions. Also renamed the Appender#isExceptionSuppressed() method to
        Appender#ignoreExceptions() to avoid the same confusion. All Appenders by default internally log and then ignore
        exceptions encountered while logging. Setting "ignoreExceptions" to "false" on an Appender causes it to allow
        exceptions to propagate to the caller. You must set "ignoreExceptions" to "false" for Appenders you are wrapping
        in the Failover Appender. (by `nickwilliams`)
* Cleaned up tests and cleared up documentation for the JPA appender following the resolution of EclipseLink
        issue #412454. (by `nickwilliams`)
* Add support for multiple SD-ELEMENTs in an RFC 5424 syslog message. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-355[LOG4J2-355] by `ggregory`)
* Allow shutdown hook to be disabled in the configuration. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-318[LOG4J2-318] by `rgoers`)
* Update commons-logging to 1.1.3 from 1.1.1. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-366[LOG4J2-366] by `ggregory`)
* Update HSQLDB dependency to 2.3.0 from 2.2.9. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-390[LOG4J2-390] by `ggregory`)
* Update Java Mail dependency to 1.5.0 from 1.4.7. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-388[LOG4J2-388] by `ggregory`)
* XML layout improvements (compact vs. pretty, namespace, namespace prefix, root element). (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-312[LOG4J2-312] by `ggregory`)
* Update JDBC tests to use H2 database 1.3.173 from 1.3.172. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-325[LOG4J2-325] by `ggregory`)
* Improved site by adding quick jump-off page and menu for Javadoc links for all components. (by `nickwilliams`)
* Update JSON Jackson library to 2.2.2 from 2.2.1. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-306[LOG4J2-306] by `ggregory`)
* Update Jackson dependency to 1.9.13 from 1.9.11. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-387[LOG4J2-387] by `ggregory`)
* Updated Async Loggers' LMAX Disruptor library from 3.0.1 to 3.2.0. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-307[LOG4J2-307] by `rpopma`)
* Clarified which library versions were used in Async Loggers performance test. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-308[LOG4J2-308] by `rpopma`)
