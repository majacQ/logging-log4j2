= 2.5 (2015-12-06)

The Apache Log4j 2 team is pleased to announce the Log4j 2.4.1 release!

Apache Log4j is a well-known framework for logging application behavior.
Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides many other modern features such as support for Markers, property substitution using Lookups, and asynchronous Loggers.
In addition, Log4j 2 will not lose events while reconfiguring.

This is the ninth GA release.
It contains several bugfixes and new features.
The new features include the ability to specify delete actions during file rollover, a CRON-based
triggering policy for file rollover, support for JSR 223 scripts in filters, pattern selectors and delete actions, and a policy for removing idle appenders from the `RoutingAppender`.
More details on the features and bugfixes are itemized below.

Log4j 2.5 requires a minimum of Java 7 to build and run.
Log4j 2.3 was the last release that supported Java 6.

Basic compatibility with Log4j 1.x is provided through the `log4j-1.2-api` component, however it does
not implement some of the very implementation specific classes and methods.
The package names and Maven `groupId` have been changed to `org.apache.logging.log4j` to avoid any conflicts with Log4j 1.x.

For complete information on Apache Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for improvement, see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[the Apache Log4j 2 website].

* Better web app support for async loggers: Fixed a memory leak that occurred when the logging jars are placed
        in the container's classpath and the configuration file uses AsyncRoot/AsyncLogger.
        The problem was that the first web application started the Disruptor background thread [AsyncLoggerConfig-1] but did not stop it until all web apps are stopped.
        Each web application now has its own Disruptor which is stopped/started together with the web app. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-323[LOG4J2-323] by `rpopma`)

* Better web app support for async loggers: it is now possible to place the logging jars in the container's
        classpath when making all loggers asynchronous by using AsyncLoggerContextSelector. This fixes a problem where
        logging would stop working after stopping and restarting a web application. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-493[LOG4J2-493] by `rpopma`)
* org.apache.logging.log4j.core.Logger should be serializable. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-801[LOG4J2-801] by `mattsicker`)
* Fixed bug where omitting the <display-name> element in web.xml caused incorrect log4j initialization,
        resulting in memory leaks when the web application was stopped or reloaded. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-873[LOG4J2-873] by `rpopma`, Martin Dickins, LC, Luke Woodward)
* Documentation: fixed minor issues with the site and manual pages. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-879[LOG4J2-879] by `rpopma`)
* Fix plugin documentation error about Converters. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-948[LOG4J2-948] by `mattsicker`, Andrew Flower)
* RollingFileAppender should also roll over when log event time is equal to rollover time, not only when later. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-999[LOG4J2-999] by `rpopma`, Joan Balagueró)
