== Changes

=== Added

* Add getFormats to MultiformatMessage and allow StructuredDataMessage to format as XML. (by `rgoers`)
* Add support for ANSI colors by adding the highlight and style pattern converters. Fix pattern
        parsing to allow nested patterns. (by `rgoers`)
* Allow the status logging to be directed to stderr or to a file. (by `rgoers`)
* Add interval and modulate options to TimeBasedTriggeringPolicy to allow more fine-grained control of
        when file rolling should occur. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-35[LOG4J2-35] by `rgoers`)
* Add support for filtering packages from stack traces. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-58[LOG4J2-58] by `rgoers`)
* If system property "disableThreadContextMap" is set puts to the ThreadContext will be ignored. If
        system property "disableThreadContext" is set both puts and pushes will be ignored. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-83[LOG4J2-83] by `rgoers`)
* If system property "disableThreadContextStack" is set pushes to the ThreadContext will be ignored. If
        system property "disableThreadContext" is set both puts and pushes will be ignored. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-84[LOG4J2-84] by `rgoers`)

=== Changed

* Made ParameterizedMessage, StringFormattedMessage and ThreadDumpMessage immutable. LocalizedMessage is
        immutable except that it will be updated with the logger name when it is added to the LogEvent. (by `rgoers`)

=== Fixed

* DefaultConfiguration was not starting the Console Appender. (by `rgoers`)
* If the ThreadContext map is empty the LogEvent will contain a null value to reduce the overhead of creating
        log events and in the size of the serialized object. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-83[LOG4J2-83] by `rgoers`)
* If the ThreadContext stack is empty the LogEvent will contain a null value to reduce the overhead of
        creating log events and in the size of the serialized object. Changed the ThreadContext stack to use
        a custom stack interface instead of java.util.Stack as that class is overly heavy. This change will
        cause an API incompatibility. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-84[LOG4J2-84] by `rgoers`)
* Many logging methods in AbstractLogger were set to an incorrect logging level. catching was
        using the THROWING marker and was set to debug instead of error. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-88[LOG4J2-88] by `rgoers`)
* Add documentation on client vs server mode to performance page. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-90[LOG4J2-90] by `rgoers`)
* Log4j 1.2 adapter's Category class was missing 3 log methods. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-91[LOG4J2-91] by `rgoers`)
* Converted DynamicThresholdFilter to use KeyValuePair. Fixed bugs in the Map-based filters
        to allow declaration of multiple values for a key to match the documentation. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-92[LOG4J2-92] by `rgoers`)
* Move variable substitution from PatternLayout to appropriate converters to improve performance. (by `rgoers`)
