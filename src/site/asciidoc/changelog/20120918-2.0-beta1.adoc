= 2.0-beta1 (2012-09-18)

== Changes

=== Added

* Added AsynchAppender. (by `rgoers`)

=== Changed

* Update the versions of SLF4J and Logback. (by `rgoers`)

=== Fixed

* Logger.error(Marker, Message, Throwable) was internally using Level.TRACE. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-74[LOG4J2-74] by `rgoers`)
* LogFactoryImpl.setAttribute in the Commons Logging bridge got a NullPointerException when passed a null value.
        It will now remove the attribute. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-78[LOG4J2-78] by `rgoers`)
* PatternLayout was not honoring format modifiers. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-81[LOG4J2-81] by `rgoers`)
* RewriteAppender was calling the stop method of the referenced appender causing the referenced appender's
        manager to have its use count decremented too many times. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-76[LOG4J2-76] by `rgoers`)
* NullPointerException in RollingFileManager when filePattern does not cause the file to be compressed. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-72[LOG4J2-72] by `rgoers`)
* Allow Log4j 2 to be used as the implementation with SLF4J and SLF4J's jcl-over-slf4j by adding filtering
        to the log method in SLF4JLogger. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-80[LOG4J2-80] by `rgoers`)
* MarkerFilter called MarkerManager.getMarker causing the Marker to be created during the processing of the
        configuration. This prevents the application from creating the Marker with any parents. MarkerWrapper in
        SLF4J-impl was getting a ClassCastException in instanceOf because the Marker isn't a MarkerWrapper. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-82[LOG4J2-82] by `rgoers`)
* RoutingAppender was calling the stop method for each of its referenced Appenders and was calling
        the stop method of the default Appender a second time. It will now only call the stop method of
        Appenders it creates. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-77[LOG4J2-77] by `rgoers`)
* Enhanced Log4jContextListener to accept a configuration file location. Modified FileConfigurationMonitor
        to monitor files configured that way. Fixed other reconfiguration related bugs. Tested in JBoss and
        Tomcat. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-75[LOG4J2-75] by `rgoers`)
* Created web module to allow web applications to include the Log4j context listener in WEB-INF/lib even if
        Log4j is in the container's class path. Allow locating the LoggerContext to include the ClassLoader. Updated
        the Loader utility to always choose the child ClassLoader. Verified in Jboss 5 and Tomcat. (by `rgoers`)
* FileRenameAction did not create the parent directories of the archive files causing the rollover to fail. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-71[LOG4J2-71] by `rgoers`)
