= 2.0.2 (2014-08-16)

The Apache Log4j 2 team is pleased to announce the Log4j 2.0.2 release!

Apache Log4j is a well-known framework for logging application behavior.
Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides many of the improvements available in Logback while fixing some inherent problems in Logback's architecture.

This is the third GA release which contains several bugfixes from the previous release.

Apache Log4j 2.0.2 requires a minimum of Java 6 to build and run.
Basic compatibility with Log4j 1.x is provided through the `log4j-1.2-api` component, however it does
not implement some of the very implementation specific classes and methods.
The package names and Maven `groupId` have been changed to `org.apache.logging.log4j` to avoid any conflicts with Log4j 1.x.

For complete information on Apache Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for improvement, see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[the Apache Log4j 2 website].
