The Apache Log4j 2 team is pleased to announce the Log4j 2.4.1 release!

Apache Log4j is a well-known framework for logging application behavior.
Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides many other modern features such as support for Markers, property substitution using Lookups, and asynchronous Loggers.
In addition, Log4j 2 will not lose events while reconfiguring.

This is the ninth GA release.
It contains several bugfixes and new features.
The new features include the ability to specify delete actions during file rollover, a CRON-based
triggering policy for file rollover, support for JSR 223 scripts in filters, pattern selectors and delete actions, and a policy for removing idle appenders from the `RoutingAppender`.
More details on the features and bugfixes are itemized below.

Log4j 2.5 requires a minimum of Java 7 to build and run.
Log4j 2.3 was the last release that supported Java 6.

Basic compatibility with Log4j 1.x is provided through the `log4j-1.2-api` component, however it does
not implement some of the very implementation specific classes and methods.
The package names and Maven `groupId` have been changed to `org.apache.logging.log4j` to avoid any conflicts with Log4j 1.x.
