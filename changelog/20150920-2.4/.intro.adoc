The Apache Log4j 2 team is pleased to announce the Log4j 2.4 release!

Apache Log4j is a well-known framework for logging application behavior.
Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides many other modern features such as support for Markers, property substitution using Lookups, and asynchronous Loggers.
In addition, Log4j 2 will not lose events while reconfiguring.

This is the eighth GA release.
It contains several bugfixes and new features.
As of this release Log4j now requires a minimum of Java 7.

Apache Log4j 2.4 requires a minimum of Java 7 to build and run.
Log4j 2.4 and greater requires Java 7, version 2.3 required Java 6.

Basic compatibility with Log4j 1.x is provided through the `log4j-1.2-api` component, however it does
not implement some of the very implementation specific classes and methods.
The package names and Maven `groupId` have been changed to `org.apache.logging.log4j` to avoid any conflicts with Log4j 1.x.

For complete information on Apache Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for improvement, see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[the Apache Log4j 2 website].
