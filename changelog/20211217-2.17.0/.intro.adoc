The Apache Log4j 2 team is pleased to announce the Log4j 2.17.0 release!

Apache Log4j is a well-known framework for logging application behavior.
Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides many other modern features such as support for Markers, lambda expressions for lazy logging, property substitution using Lookups, multiple patterns on a `PatternLayout` and asynchronous Loggers.
Another notable Log4j 2 feature is the ability to be _garbage-free_ (avoid allocating temporary objects) while logging.
In addition, Log4j 2 will not lose events while reconfiguring.

The artifacts may be downloaded from https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html[].

The major changes contained in this release include:

* Address CVE-2021-45105 by disabling recursive evaluation of Lookups during log event processing.
Recursive evaluation is still allowed while generating the configuration.
* The `JndiLookup`, `JndiContextSelector`, and `JMSAppender` now require individual system properties to be enabled.
* Remove LDAP and LDAPS as supported protocols from JNDI.

The single `log4j2.enableJndi` property introduced in Log4j 2.16.0 has been replaced with three individual properties; `log4j2.enableJndiContextSelector`, `log4j2.enableJndiJms`, and `log4j2.enableJndiLookup`.

The Log4j 2.17.0 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.

Apache Log4j 2.17.0 requires a minimum of Java 8 to build and run.
Log4j 2.12.2 is the last release to support Java 7.
Java 7 is no longer supported by the Log4j team.
