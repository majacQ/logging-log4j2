The Apache Log4j 2 team is pleased to announce the Log4j 2.7 release!

Apache Log4j is a well-known framework for logging application behavior.
Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides many other modern features such as support for Markers, lambda expressions for lazy logging, property substitution using Lookups, multiple patterns on a `PatternLayout` and asynchronous Loggers.
Another notable Log4j 2 feature is the ability to be _garbage-free_ (avoid allocating temporary objects) while logging.
In addition, Log4j 2 will not lose events while reconfiguring.

This release contains several bugfixes and new features.
The new features include new logging API modules for Scala 2.10 and 2.11, and support for various non-blocking queue implementations in `AsyncAppender`.
Furthermore the `ThreadContext` map can now be configured to be garbage-free, and users can now inject context data from other sources than `ThreadContext`.
Context data values can be any `Object`, not just ``String``s.
More details on the fixes are itemized below.

Note that subsequent to the 2.6 release a minor source incompatibility was found due to the addition of new methods to the `Logger` interface.
If you have code that does:

[source,java]
----
logger.error(null, “This is the log message”, throwable);
----

or similar with any log level you will get a compiler error saying the reference is ambiguous.
To correct this either do:

[source,java]
----
logger.error(“This is the log message”, throwable);
----

or

[source,java]
----
logger.error((Marker) null, “This is the log message”, throwable);
----

The Log4j 2.7 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.

Log4j 2.7 requires a minimum of Java 7 to build and run.
Log4j 2.3 was the last release that supported Java 6.

Basic compatibility with Log4j 1.x is provided through the `log4j-1.2-api` component, however it does
not implement some of the very implementation specific classes and methods.
The package names and Maven `groupId` have been changed to `org.apache.logging.log4j` to avoid any conflicts with Log4j 1.x.
